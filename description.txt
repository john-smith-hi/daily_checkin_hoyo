Interface Page 1:
* Contains 4 images with check marks indicating their statuses.

Interface Page 2:
* Includes the 4 images from Page 1 along with checkboxes.
* Only the images that are checked on Page 2 will be displayed on Page 1.

Background operation:
* Automatically sends requests to the links defined in `config.js` and the settings (from Page 2) **only** when the user **installs the extension** or **opens the browser**, without repeating.
* Optimize performance by **minimizing the number of requests** while still maintaining functionality.
